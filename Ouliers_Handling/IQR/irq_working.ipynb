    "🎯 What is IQR?\n",
    "\n",
    "IQR is the range of the middle 50% of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a dataset is tightly packed → IQR is small\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.5 × 20 = 30 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So our boundaries become:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower = 150 − 30 = 120 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper = 170 + 30 = 200 cm\n",

    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "120–200 cm → reasonable human height\n",
    "\n",
    "below 120 or above 200 → unusual (outliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "So 1.5 × IQR gives a realistic buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It creates a range that:\n",
    "\n",
    "is wider than the middle 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "but not so wide that everything becomes normal"
