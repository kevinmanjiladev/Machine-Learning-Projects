Logistic regression is a technique used for classififcation

Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous number, 
logistic regression predicts a probability 
— specifically, the probability that an input belongs to a particular class.

Example
---------
Predict if a student will pass or fail based on study hours.
The output is:

Probability of pass (between 0 and 1)
-------------------------------------
If probability > 0.5 → classify as Pass

If probability < 0.5 → classify as Fail


🎯 Why logistic?
---------------------
Because it uses a logistic (sigmoid) function to convert linear values into probabilities:

----------------
𝜎(z)=1/(1+e^-z)
----------------


This ensures the output is always between 0 and 1.


When do we use Logistic Regression?
----------------------------------

-Spam or Not Spam

-Yes or No

-Fraud or Not Fraud

-Disease or No Disease

-Click or No Click​


These are binary classification tasks.

_________________________________________________
| Study Hours | Probability Pass | Final Output |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 2 hrs       | 0.20             | Fail         |
| 6 hrs       | 0.87             | Pass         |

Types of Logistic Regression
----------------------------
1️⃣ Binary (two outputs)
2️⃣ Multiclass (one vs rest)
3️⃣ Multinomial
