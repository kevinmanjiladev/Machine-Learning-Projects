Bagging:
--------
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning used to reduce variance, prevent overfitting, and improve model stability, especially for high-variance algorithms like decision trees.

Bagging trains multiple models on different random subsets of the training data (sampled with replacement) and then combines their outputs.

Think of it like:

    Asking many people the same question after giving each person slightly different information.
    Then taking the majority vote (classification) or average (regression).


🔍 How Bagging Works
----------------------
Step 1: Bootstrap Sampling

    From the original dataset with N samples, create k new datasets of size N,

    Each dataset is created by random sampling with replacement (so some rows repeat).

Step 2: Train Models

    Train k separate models (usually weak learners).

Step 3: Aggregate Predictions

    Classification: majority vote

    Regression: average of predictions



✔ When to Use Bagging

    Use bagging when:

    Your model overfits.

    Your model is high variance (like decision trees).

    You want higher accuracy.

    You have noisy data.
