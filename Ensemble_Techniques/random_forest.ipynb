    "Random Forest = Bagging + Feature Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is the most popular algorithm that uses bagging internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make more accurate and stable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on two main ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1)Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2)Random feature selection at each split\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes Random Forest powerful, less overfitted, and more robust than a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌳 Simple Explanation\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "Think of a Random Forest as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    “A group of decision trees. Each tree votes, and the forest decides the final answer.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 How Random Forest Works\n",
    "1. Bootstrapping the Data (Bagging)\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "    From the original dataset (N rows), the algorithm creates multiple new datasets (each of size N) by sampling with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each dataset is used to train one tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Feature Selection\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a tree tries to split a node, it does NOT look at all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instead, it picks a random subset of features and chooses the best split among those.(for eg: the algorithm selects a random subset of features at each split.Then it finds the best feature among them to become the root node (or next node).)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This randomness creates diverse trees, which improves accuracy and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Aggregation\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classification: majority vote of all trees\n",
    "\n",
    "    Regression: average of all trees' predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Intuition Behind Random Forest\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "A single tree is unstable.\n",
    "Small changes in data → big changes in outputs.(Low Bias,High variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "A forest averages many diverse trees → stable + generalizable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to predict whether a customer will buy a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest will:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create, say, 100 bootstrapped datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "    Train 100 decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "    Combine predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -If 70 trees say Yes, 30 say No → final prediction = Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Random Forest Hyperparameters (Important)\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "    n_estimators: number of trees\n",
    "\n",
    "    max_depth: maximum depth of each tree\n",
    "\n",
    "    max_features: number of random features per split\n",
    "\n",
    "    min_samples_split: minimum samples to split a node\n",
    "    (min_samples_split refers to the number of rows (data points) required in a node before a decision tree is allowed to split that node into branches.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    bootstrap: whether to use bootstrapping (usually True)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- Python Code -->\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n",

    "✓ When Should You Use Random Forest?\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "    When your model is overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you want the best accuracy with minimal tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you have many features\n",
